GIT: Git is a content management and tracking system developed by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. 
    It includes a directory that continuously changes as codes are added throughout application or website development. 

GITHUB: GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. 

Repository:Git repository is just a file location where you are storing all the files related to your project.

Clone: Clone in GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo,make a copy.

Commit: Git Commits. A Git commit is a snapshot of the hierarchy and the contents of the files  in a Git repository
       These endpoints allow you to read and write commit objects to your Git database on GitHub.

Push:Pushing to GitHub means uploading to a GitHub repositor

Pull:Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

Branch:Creating a branch On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
       Click the branch selector menu. Type a unique name for your new branch, then select Create branch.

Merge:Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again
      Currently, Test Branch is ahead of the Master by 1 commit.
      Let’s say that now we want all the code in the Test Branch to be brought back to the Master Branch. 
      This is where git merge is very useful.

Merge Conflict: two branches were changed on the same line or in the same content of a file before a merge.

Fetch: git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository 
      - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files

remote:A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
